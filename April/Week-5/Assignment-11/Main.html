          Red Fort, also called Lal Qalʿah, also spelled Lal Kila or Lal Qila,
          Mughal fort in Old Delhi, India. It was built by Shah Jahān in the
          mid-17th century and remains a major tourist attraction. The fort was
          designated a in 2007.
          <br />The fort’s massive red sandstone walls, which stand 75 feet (23
          metres) high, enclose a complex of palaces and entertainment halls,
          projecting balconies, baths and indoor canals, and geometrical
          gardens, as well as an ornate mosque. Among the most famous structures
          of the complex are the Hall of Public Audience (Diwan-i-ʿAm), which
          has 60 red sandstone pillars supporting a flat roof, and the Hall of
          Private Audience (Diwan-i-Khas), which is smaller and has a pavilion
          of white. <br /><br />
          An earlier red fort had been built in Old Delhi in the 11th century by
          the Tomara king Anangapala. The Quṭb Mosque now stands on the site.

          Mughal architecture, building style that flourished in northern and
          central India under the patronage of the Mughal emperors from the
          mid-16th to the late 17th century. The Mughal period marked a striking
          revival of Islamic architecture in northern India. Under the patronage
          of the Mughal emperors, Persian, Indian, and various provincial styles
          were fused to produce works of unusual quality and refinement.
          <br /><br />
          Formerly known as Quila-e-Mubarak or the Blessed Fort, the Red Fort
          lies along the banks of the river Yamuna, whose waters fed the moats
          surrounding the fort. It was a part of the medieval city of
          Shahjahanabad, popularly known today as 'Old Delhi'. The entire fort
          complex is said to represent the architectural creativity and
          brilliance of Mughal architecture. With so much history and heritage
          associated with it, the Red Fort is one of the most popular monuments
          in India and a major tourist attraction in Delhi. It became a UNESCO
          world heritage site in 2007. The Archaeological Survey of India is at
          present responsible for the security and preservation of this
          magnificent monument.
          <br /><br />
          The construction of Red Fort began in the holy month of Muharram, on
          13 May 1638. It took nine years to build, and under the supervision of
          Shahjahan, the Fort was completed on 6 April 1648. To contain the
          older Salimgarh Fort inside its boundaries, the walls were built
          asymmetrical, unlike any other Mughal buildings. It remained the seat
          of Imperial Mughal Rule till 1857 when the Great Revolt took place. It
          consists of several other structures which were built during Shah
          Jahan's life, and some which were added by the later rulers. His son
          and successor Aurangzeb, added the Pearl Mosque or the Moti Masjid to
          the fort complex when he took over as the emperor after a fierce War
          of succession between him and his three brothers.
