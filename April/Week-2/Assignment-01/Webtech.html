    <h3>HTML</h3>
    <p>
      HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages
      using a markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup
      language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. A markup
      language is used to define the text document within tag which defines the
      structure of web pages.
    </p>

    <p></p>
    <p>
      This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so
      that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most
      markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags to
      define what manipulation has to be done on the text.
    </p>
    <p>
      Covers the absolute basics of HTML, to get you started — we define
      elements, attributes, and other important terms, and show where they fit
      in the language. We also show how a typical HTML page is structured and
      how an HTML element is structured, and explain other important basic
      language features. Along the way, we'll play with some HTML to get you
      interested!

      this is a <p> tag

    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <p>
      Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed
      language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
      CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables
      you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page. CSS is
      easy to learn and understand, but it provides powerful control over the
      presentation of an HTML document.
    </p>
    <p>
      A CSS comprises style rules that are interpreted by the browser and then
      applied to the corresponding elements in your document. A style rule set
      consists of a selector and declaration block.
    </p>
    <h3>Javascript</h3>
    <p>
      It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was an engineer at
      Netscape. It was originally going to be named LiveScript but was renamed.
      Unlike most programming languages, the JavaScript language has no concept
      of input or output.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is designed to run as a scripting language in a host environment, and
      it is up to the host environment to provide mechanisms for communicating
      with the outside world. The most common host environment is the browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adding interactivity and behavior to static sites JavaScript was invented
      to do this in 1995. By using AngularJS that can be achieved so easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Artists and designers can create whatever they want using JavaScript to
      draw on HTML 5 canvas, make the sound more effective also can be used
      p5.js library.
